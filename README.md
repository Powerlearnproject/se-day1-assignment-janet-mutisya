Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the process of designing and maintaing software application one of its importance is its helps create reliable and user friendly software applictions, it also ensures that software  is developed in a structured way making it easy to maintain update and debug

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of the first high-leval programing language  was 1950 - 1960 before this proggramers had to write codes in machine language wich was incredibbly tiresome
The rise of personal computers in   1970-1980 this made software accessible to a wider audience and new applictions emerging in area like spreadsheet and gaming
The advert of the internet and the world  in 1990 enabling the creation of web based application like HTML Javascrupt and CSS

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
initiation here we define the project goals
Planning here we define the project goals scope ancd reqirements
Execution we assign the task to members and implement project plans 
monitoring and control we track the project and perfiom quality control and manage changes
closure finalize all the project activities
Compare and contrast the Waterfall nd Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is less flexible eg building a largesoftware system 
it is  also plan driven everthing is planned out in advanced
documentation lots of document is created withn the process
AGILE is flexible  changes can be done
There is continous planning
documentation in agile is minimized

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
coding this entails writting the actual code for the developer
problem solving by finding creative solutions to problemds 
testing to make sure a sftware works
colllaboration working with other software developers
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. its 
one importanc is code editing and code completion
debugging they offer debbuging tools thst make it easy to find bugs
helps in project management 
EXAMPLES  OF IDES
visual studio code 
eclipse
pycharm
version control system are like time machine for our codes they keep track of every changes made
Examples of version control system 
git 
github
bitbucket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
one challlenge faced by software engineers is keeping up with the technology because its evolving
meeting deadlines they often have tight deadlines engineers must juggle and multitaskt to manage there time well
staying motivated
dealing woith large teams
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit test are close to the source of an application and they consist in the testing individuals methods  and functions of classes components or modules used by software
intergration test helps ensure data flows smoothly
system testing it focuses on the entire software
acceptance test this are the test that verifys if the system satisfies business requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this the process where you guide generative al solutions to generate desired output
IMPORTANCES;improved user experience it make it easy for user to obtain relevant results in the first prompt 
increased flexibility;
clarity the improved prompt specifys what is been asked
Provide an example ofa vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
clarity
specific details
